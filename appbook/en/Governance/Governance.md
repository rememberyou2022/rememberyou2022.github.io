# Governance 

## Ecological Fund
PrayDAO established a foundation in Singapore as the main body of the project, responsible for the fair, just and transparent operation of the PrayDAO community.

The foundation's 2% market transaction fee is used for the management fee of the team's R&D operation, and no less than 5% of the transaction fee is returned to the PrayDAO ecosystem, which is given in the form of airdrops or rewards.

Other taxes collected will be included in the fund management pool, and their distribution will be voted on by the community DAO.

## Community
PrayDAO is managed by DAO, which means that the community has absolute governance rights, and members can pledge Token through voting and other methods.

## Voting rights
Users can obtain higher voting rights by staking tokens.

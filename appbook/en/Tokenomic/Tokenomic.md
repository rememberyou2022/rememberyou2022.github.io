# Economic model

## Token
PrayDAO will have dual tokens, namely interactive game token (SCORE) and governance token (HOPE).

SCORE is used for activities in various application scenarios of PrayApp, such as creating new Eikons, changing the background of the scene, and upgrading the lotus base of the Eikons.

As the only token officially issued by PrayDAO, HOPE is the governance token of the PrayDAO ecosystem. It is mainly used for governance activities such as profit distribution formed by PrayApp activities and voting on the development direction and functions of PrayApp.

The supply of SCORE is unlimited, and users are generated during the interaction of commemoration and prayer.

HOPE is limited, with a total of 6 billion pieces.

According to the number of Eikon NFTs owned by users, their attributes and the popularity of application scenarios, PrayApp will distribute them to users on a weekly basis. PrayDAO will also airdrop from time to time to users who hold level 7, 8, and 9 Eikon NFTs (the creation Eikon NFT is level 9).

The HOPE yield is 10% of the user's SCORE yield; for example, a user will get 1 HOPE for every 10 SCORE earned.

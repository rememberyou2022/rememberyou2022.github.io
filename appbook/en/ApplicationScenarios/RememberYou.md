# What is RememberYou

RememberYou will aim to commemorate the "disappeared" relatives and friends - allowing the deceased to be immortalized on the blockchain. The project team very much agrees with the concept in "Dream Hunting Travel Notes" that the real death of a person is that the world has forgotten him/her. So, for this he/she, we keep him/her on the blockchain and let him/her be remembered by the world.

The application will take a memorial wall (the background of the memorial wall can be replaced) as the core, and provide the on-chain storage function of the memorialized person's data (including 4 pictures and 3 audios); provide 5 NFT statue guard slots; for users Provide interactive actions such as "weeding", "listen to his/her story", "friend messages" with relatives and friends. Turn commemorative activities from simple page browsing to interactive activities with pictures and texts (audio) and relaxing mood.

In RememberYou, the scene has a popularity value. After the user has an Eikon NFT, the popularity value will be increased according to the attributes of the Eikon, and the popularity value will affect the later mint. At the same time, Eikon NFT can delay the growth of vine man (grass) in application scenarios.

Definition of popularity value: The cumulative value of weekly visits.
The upper limit of weekly popularity bonus is related to the number of Eikons held by the user and the rarity of the Eikons. Users can purchase more Eikons to increase the upper limit. The weekly popularity bonus is calculated by the mana of the Eikon. For details, please refer to the mana of the Eikon

The basic popularity value defaults to 50. Popularity value = last week's popularity value (new users are the basic popularity value) * (1 + weekly popularity value bonus)

In the later stage, we may add more gameplay such as the consumption of popularity value over time.

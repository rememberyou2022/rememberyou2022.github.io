# Quick Start

## Prepare
Please make sure that your browser has installed wallet plugins such as MetaMask. Or you already know how to use a crypto wallet (Ethereum).

## Start
Open the official website and connect the wallet

Select the application scenario RememberYou or PrayForLife

Then select the Eikon (if you have multiple Eikon NFTs) to configure the memorial wall

If you don't have a god statue NFT, please create a god statue on the official website Mint, limited to 1000 copies, first come first served

If the official website is sold out, please go to OpenSea and other markets to buy it yourself

In the future, we will launch the ordinary Eikon Mint

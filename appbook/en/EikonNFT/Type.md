# Eikon type
In order to reflect that God created the world, we selected 14 gods and drew their dharma images as the gods of creation. They are:
(1) Sakyamuni;  
(2) Ancient Buddha with Burning Lamp;
(3) Maitreya Buddha;
(4) Virgin Mary;
(5) Jesus Christ;
(6) Muhammad;
(7) Primordial Deity;
(8) Moral Deity;
(9) Lord Brahma;
(10) Lord Vishnu;
(11) Lord Shiva;
(12) Zeus (Khaos/Chaos);
(13) Gaea;
(14) Amaterasu

This batch of creation statues will have the highest level 9 in the PrayApp system. This batch of Eikons will serve as the creators of the follow-up Eikon NFTs. Only those who own the creation Eikons can create the next-level Eikon NFTs.

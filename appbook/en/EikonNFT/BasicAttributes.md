# Basic attributes of Eikons

## Energy value (hp) --- wear
The energy value of the Eikon is similar to the life value of the game characters and will be automatically consumed over time. Through interactive activities (such as: leaving a message, weeding, and mindfulness can increase energy value), or by exchanging SCORE points to increase ability value.

## Mana (mp) --- Bonus factor
The mana value of the Eikon is the source of the guardian ability of the Eikon, and the mana value gradually decreases with the deterioration of the application environment such as the growth of vines (grass). The mana value of the Eikon can be increased by stacking accessories (such as diamonds, bracelets, necklaces, etc.), and the ability value can also be increased by exchanging SCORE points.

## Luck
The statue has a certain level of luck according to the level. After reaching a certain level, in activities such as airdrops, there will be different harvests depending on the level of luck.

More games will be introduced in the future to increase the luck value.

## level
Different levels of Eikons have different initial values ​​of mana and luck.

The Eikon has 1-9 levels. The larger the level number, the higher the level, the greater the initial value it has, and the higher the luck and mana value in the entire application.

# Eikon mint

Statues are the first to release Statues of Creation. We will release low-level statues according to the progress of the project.
Low-level Eikons can be mint from two Genesis Eikons, or two mint of Eikons of the specified level.

The rarity probability of mint Eikons is related to the current average ranking index of the two Eikons.
The ranking index is calculated by the comprehensive ranking of the attribute values ​​of each Eikon among all the Eikons. Different attributes have different weights, and the details of the weights are not disclosed for the time being. The index ranges from 0 - 100. The higher the index, the more popular the Eikon is, and the higher the probability of hatching a rare Eikon.

## Average Rank Index

50% of the sum of the ranking indices of the two Eikons

Tokens need to be paid for each mint, and the token price is related to the above index, the number of mint and other factors.

Wait 48 hours after each mint before continuing to mint

The following are the rarity probabilities of mint Eikons
